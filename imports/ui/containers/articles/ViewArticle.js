              As companies emerge from the recessionary economic climate of the past three years, there has been a shift toward investing for growth and away from cost reduction. Twenty-four percent now say they are investing for growth in the coming year, while only 16 percent said they were doing this over the past three years, representing a significant shift toward investment. Many companies, though, are hedging their bets, cautiously entering growth mode while still maintaining a rigorous focus on cost containment.

            <p>
              Given this renewed emphasis on growth and investment, which factors do business leaders view as most critical to success? People-oriented “soft” factors dominate this list. The top three success factors identified in this study were achieving a high level of customer service, effective communications, and achieving a high level of employee engagement and strong executive leadership (tied for third place), tools like http://theLeader.io is trying to address such concerns.

              This places employee engagement as a top-three business priority. This is not surprising. For the past several years, companies have been increasingly monitoring their engagement levels, as a growing body of research has demonstrated that having a highly engaged workforce not only maximizes a company’s investment in human capital and improves productivity, but it can also significantly reduce costs, such as turnover, that directly impact the bottom line. By using http://theLeader.io I could achieve great results in Vietnam on reducing employee turnover rate and increase employee engagement significantly.

              Much has been studied about the impact of employee engagement on company performance, and there is general agreement that increased engagement drives results: Gallup, for example, suggests a 20% or better boost to productivity and profitability for companies with high engagement. Such companies, however, may be few and far between: Gallup also reports that only 30% of American workers, and 13% of global workers, are engaged in their jobs.

              Measurement reliability and validity are important prerequisites of an effective engagement survey. Let's review Aon Hewitt’s employee engagement model. Use of the term “employee engagement” seems ubiquitous, and most organizations use a general definition of engagement as something beyond satisfaction that describes an employee’s discretionary effort, in next series of my post I will try to share my thoughts on this model and how can it be optimized and executed with various techniques and tools such as http://theLeader.io
